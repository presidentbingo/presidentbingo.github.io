QUESTION: When economists want to model the effects of a per-unit tax (for example, a tax of $3 for every unit of the good sold), there are a number of ways they can do it.  \r\n\r\nOne of those ways is to create a &quot;tax-included&quot; supply curve by shifting up the supply curve by the amount of the tax. Then, the intersection of the demand curve with the tax-included supply curve determines the equilibrium quantity and the price that consumers pay, and the old supply curve at that equilibrium quantity determ

QUESTION: Thick wool socks can be very handy during the winter months, especially in blizzard conditions. Assume that there is Christmas-time, and there is a blizzard outside. You currently have $10$ pairs of socks (no socks have been eaten by the dryer), and your utility from a complete pair of socks is $1$.   You do not gain utility from sock puppets, so a single, unpaired sock gives you a utility of $0$.  What is your marginal utility if your mom gives you one left sock as a Christmas present (and this is the only present you receive)? What is your marginal utility

TITLE: Microeconomics - Properties of Demand: Hicks Demand, not Hick\'s
QUESTION: Regular demand curves are based on the idea of *maximizing utility* subject to a *budget constraint*. This can lead to some weird results. For example, because real demand curves exhibit both the *income effect* and the *substitution effect*, it\'s possible for them to sometimes slope down and sometimes slope up!  \r\n\r\nAddressing this is the *Hicksian demand curve*, or the *compensated demand curve*.

TITLE: Microeconomics - Monopoly: No, It\'s Not Competitive
QUESTION: Monopolistic firms tend to earn an economic profit.  \r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible for every firm in competitive markets to earn economic profits too! For example, imagine a competitive market for snow shovels, and a freak snow storm drives up the demand for snow shovels extremely high. Everyone will be able to make a profit until more suppliers join the market.  \r\n\r\nGiven that you can make a profit  in either kind of market, why might economists be more concerned about the profits they see in monopolistic markets than in competitive
ANSWER: D: Because profits in competitive markets quickly go away, while profits in monopolistic markets persist for a long time.

TITLE: Microeconomics - Price Discrimination: Less Dead
QUESTION: Firms with pricing power, like monopolies, tend to produce inefficiently low quantities. Whenever there is inefficiency, there is a deadweight loss. So there is a deadweight loss associated with pricing power.  \r\n\r\nHowever, under first degree price discrimination, where the firm can charge each consumer their exact marginal value, there is no deadweight loss.  \r\n\r\nWhich of the following is an intuitive explanation for why this is?
ANSWER: C: Because the firm can lower prices for consumers with low marginal values without lowering prices for everyone else.

QUESTION: Consider a monopolist who does not price discriminate.

TITLE: Microeconomics - Oligopoly: Mr. Self Destruct
QUESTION: In an oligopoly, there are a small number of firms selling identical goods. Ideally, all of these firms would like to keep the price higher than the competitive market level, since this will bring each of them higher profits than if they all lowered their prices.  \r\n\r\nHowever, this sort of arrangement (where prices are kept above the competitive level) has a tendency to self-destruct. Each of the firms in the oligopoly has an incentive to lower their own price.  \r\n\r\nWhy is this?
