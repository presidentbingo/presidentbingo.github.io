<li>QUESTION: When economists want to model the effects of a per-unit tax (for example, a tax of $3 for every unit of the good sold), there are a number of ways they can do it.  \r\n\r\nOne of those ways is to use a &quot;Tax Wedge.&quot; You start with a standard supply and demand graph, and then make a vertical &quot;wedge&quot; that has a height equal to the amount of the tax. Then you move the wedge further and further in until it gets &quot;stuck&quot; on the supply and demand curves and can\'t fit in any more. Then, t</li>

<li>TITLE: Microeconomics - Market Interventions: Tacks Tax</li>
<li>QUESTION: In the market for metal tacks, the demand and supply curves are:    \r\n\r\n$$P = 90 - 2Q_d$$  \r\n$$P = 10 + 2Q_s$$  \r\n\r\nDue to an unexpected increase in public expenditure, the government needs to collect some new tax revenue fast! So they decide to impose a per-unit tax on tacks (so, for every box of tacks sold, the government collects a fixed fee). However, there is a rule requiring that no government tax can impose a deadweight loss larger than 2.  \r\n\r\nWhat is the *largest* tax that the government can impose?</li>

<li>TITLE: Microeconomics - Elasticity: Oven Options</li>
<li>QUESTION: Before the introduction of microwaves, there were not a lot of substitutes for ovens. If you wanted to cook, you pretty much needed an oven. This is the &quot;before&quot; time. At this time, it just so happened that the quantity of ovens demanded was $Q_d=10$.  \r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of microwaves, some people would consider microwaves as an acceptable substitute for ovens. This is the &quot;after&quot; time. This changed the demand curve for ovens. After there had been some changes to supply as well, it turned out that $Q_d=10$ in the after time.  \r\</li>

<li>TITLE: Microeconomics - Marginal Utility of Socks</li>
<li>QUESTION: Thick wool socks can be very handy during the winter months, especially in blizzard conditions. Assume that there is Christmas-time, and there is a blizzard outside. You currently have $10$ pairs of socks (no socks have been eaten by the dryer), and your utility from a complete pair of socks is $1$.   You do not gain utility from sock puppets, so a single, unpaired sock gives you a utility of $0$.  What is your marginal utility if your mom gives you one left sock as a Christmas present (and this is the only present you receive)? What is your marginal utility </li>
<li>üòà ANSWER: A: Marginal utility of 1 left sock = 0, marginal utility of 1 right sock = 0</li>

<li>QUESTION: Consider Paige\'s preferences for Goods $L$, $M$, and $N$.  She has the following preferences: $L \\succ M \\succ N$.  Of course, this can be represented by a utility function (or utility functions, for that matter).  Let\'s say utility function $u$ gives us the following values to Paige when she consumes $L$, $M$, or $N$:    \r\n\r\n$$u(L) = 10, u(M) = 5, u(N)= 1$$  \r\n\r\nWhile the utility function $v$ results in the following values for the goods:    \r\n\r\n$$v(L) = 100, v(M) = 55, v(N)= 1$$  \r\n\r\nAre these two functions $u$ and $v$ ordina</li>

<li>TITLE: Microeconomics - Bliss Points and Preferences</li>
<li>QUESTION: We tend to assume that consumption of goods is monotonically increasing: the more of a particular good we consume, the better off we are.  However, that\'s not always the case.  The &quot;consumption&quot; of pollution or illness, for example, is not monotonically increasing.  All else being equal, we probably want less pollution and less illness.  One interesting case of non-monotonicity is the case of bliss points, the *perfect* combination of goods.  \r\n\r\nFor example, parents might think it\'s best to have two kids, and more specifically, to have </li>

For example, because real demand curves exhibit both the *income effect* and the *substitution effect*, it\'s possible for them to sometimes slope down and sometimes slope up!  \r\n\r\nAddressing this is the *Hicksian demand curve*, or the *compensated demand curve*.

<li>QUESTION: Firms with pricing power, like monopolies, tend to produce inefficiently low quantities. Whenever there is inefficiency, there is a deadweight loss. So there is a deadweight loss associated with pricing power.  \r\n\r\nHowever, under first degree price discrimination, where the firm can charge each consumer their exact marginal value, there is no deadweight loss.  \r\n\r\nWhich of the following is an intuitive explanation for why this is?</li>

<li>QUESTION: *Matching Pennies* games are $2x2$ and *constant-sum* games with a *unique* and *totally-mixed* equilibrium. This means no player has a *dominant* strategy. It also means the game has only one equilibrium where both players are assigning a probability that is strictly positive but less than one to each of their two available options.  \r\n\r\nThe name comes from imagining two players throwing (or simultaneously showing) a coin each.

Also, every player always has at least one *rationalizable* strategy.
